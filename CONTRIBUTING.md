## Ways to Contribute

You can help Repo-lyzer by:

- 🐛 Reporting bugs
- ✨ Proposing or implementing new features
- 🧠 Improving scoring algorithms (health, bus factor, maturity)
- 🎨 Enhancing TUI layout, styling, or UX
- 🧪 Adding tests or improving reliability
- 📚 Improving documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Go 1.21+**
- Git
- A GitHub account
- (Optional) GitHub Personal Access Token to avoid rate limits

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Fork the Repository
Click **Fork** on GitHub and clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Repo-lyzer.git
cd Repo-lyzer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```go mod tidy```

### 3. Run the CLI Locally
```go run main.go```


### Or install it locally:
```bash
go install
repo-lyzer
```

## Guidelines:

+ Keep GitHub API logic inside internal/github
+ Keep scoring logic isolated in internal/analyzer
+ Keep UI rendering inside internal/output
+ Avoid mixing API, logic, and UI code
+ GitHub API & Tokens
+ Repo-lyzer uses the GitHub REST API and may hit rate limits.
+ Optional: Use a Personal Access Token

## Create a token and export it:
`export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here`

Repo-lyzer will automatically detect and use it.

**⚠️ Never commit tokens or secrets.**

## Coding Guidelines
***Go Style***

* Follow standard Go formatting (gofmt)
* Keep functions small and readable
* Prefer clear logic over clever tricks

***TUI & UX***

* Keep layouts responsive to terminal size
* Avoid hardcoded widths when possible
* Ensure output remains readable on small terminals
* Test changes with repositories of different sizes and activity levels

## Performance

* Minimize unnecessary API calls
* Handle large repositories gracefully
* Cache or batch requests when possible

## Adding Features

* Before implementing large features:
* Open an issue describing the idea
* Explain why it’s useful
* Discuss the approach if it affects architecture or scoring
* This avoids duplicated work and design conflicts.

## Testing

While automated tests are limited due to API usage and TUI complexity:

Manually test with:

* Highly active repos
* Old but inactive repos
* Test both Analyze and Compare modes
* Verify behavior with and without a GitHub token

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. Create a Branch
```git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name```

2. Make Your Changes

Ensure:

+ Code builds successfully
+ TUI renders correctly
+ No secrets are committed

3. Commit Your Changes
```git commit -m "Add: short description of change"```

4. Push and Open a PR
```git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name```


## Open a Pull Request on GitHub and include:

* What the change does
* Why it’s needed
* Screenshots (for UI changes)
* Commit Message Guidelines
* Use clear, concise messages:
* Add: recruiter summary panel
* Fix: handle empty contributor list
* Improve: commit activity graph rendering
* Refactor: separate GitHub client logic
